# Anything worth doing is diffcult at first

As you study this book, and continue with programing,remeber that anything worth doing is diffcult at first. Maybe you are the kind of person who is afraid of failure so you give up at the first sign of diffculty. Maybe you never learned self-discipline so you can't do anything that's "boring". Maybe you were told that you are "gifted" so you never attempt anything that might make you seem stupid or not aprodigy. Maybe you are competitive and unfairly compare yourself to someone like me who's been programming for more than 20 years.

hatever your reason for wanting to quit, keep at it. Force yourself. If you run into a Study Drill you can't do, or a lesson you just do not understand, then skip it and come back to it later. Just keep going because with programming there's this very odd thing that happend. At first, you will not understand anything. It'll be weird, just like with learning any human language. You will snap and you will suddenly "get it". If you keep doing the exercises and keep trying to understand them you, will get it. You might not be a master coder, but you will at least understand how programming works.
